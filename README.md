# Category 1
The artifact I have selected for category one is a .cpp file of a simple brokerage app. The .cpp file used a single hardcoded user password and had 3 menu options. I created this a few months ago as part of another class for my degree. I have taken the original file and transformed it into a python program with added features and security. I selected this artifact because I think it’s easy to identify the changes made and the improvements from the first .cpp file to the new .py file. While I am happy with its current progress, I will be adding more enhancements as part of category two and three for the final project. I want to show my abilities to take something simple and turn it into a functional program with a working database and interface. As of now, the artifact meets several of the course outcomes but will eventually meet all of them. 
	The process of modifying and enhancing the artifact was a fun one. While the python language is one I am familiar with having taken several classes using it, it’s been a while since I have actually used it. I used various internet resources to refresh my memory on syntax but after that it was relatively smooth sailing. Since this artifact was already programed in c++ I was able to transcribe it in python using a lot of the same concepts just in a different language. One of my focuses was on input validation as well as secure coding best practices.
